# Playwright_Cucumber_Test_Automation


## Description:

The Playwright_Cucumber_Test_Automation  is a test automation framework that utilizes a customized hybrid test architecture, incorporating the Page Object Model (POM), Data-Driven, and Keyword-Driven approaches. It leverages the power of Behavior-Driven Development (BDD) frameworks. The suite rigorously tests the fundamental functionalities of the Book Cart application and is primarily designed for demonstration purposes.

These tests cover end-to-end scenarios:

- **TC001**: User Registration Tests
- **TC002**: User Authentication Tests
- **TC003**: Order Process Tests

## Test Automation Tools:

- **Playwright**: A robust automation tool for web applications.
- **Cucumber**:  A Behavior Driven Development (BDD) framework written in Gherkin language to enhance test readability and collaboration.
- **JavaScript**: The scripting language used for this test suite.

## Project Structure:

- `config/cucumber.js`: Custom configuration file for the test suite, replacing playwright.config.js.
- `src/helper/report/`: Configuration for custom test reports.
- `src/helper/util/test-data/`: Test data repository used in the tests.
- `src/helper/util/logger.js`: Configuration file for the test logger utilized in the tests.
- `src/helper/util/wrapper/`: Custom reusable base functions employed in the tests.
- `src/hooks/`: Custom hooks utilized in the tests.
- `src/pages/`: Classes representing a Page Object Model (POM) design.
- `src/test/features/`: Tests written in Gherkin language.
- `src/test/steps/`: Step definitions that map Gherkin scenarios to test data, page objects, and methods.
- `test-results/`: Automatically generated test results including:
  - **logs**: Test logs.
  - **index.html**: Enhanced test report generated by "multiple-cucumber-html-reporter."
  - **videos**: Screen recording videos of the tests.
  - **cucumber-report.html**: Default Cucumber HTML report.
  - **cucumber-report.json**: Default Cucumber JSON report.

*Note: The entire `test-results` folder or individual files can be safely deleted.*
